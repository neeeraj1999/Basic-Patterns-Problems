Sam is making a forest visualizer. An N-dimensional forest is represented by the pattern of size NxN filled with ‘*’.
For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional forest.
Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
* * *
* * *
* * *
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1  <= N <= 25
Time Limit: 1 sec



## Solution in Python

def nForest(n:int) ->None:
    # Write your solution here.
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        print("* "*n)

## Solution in cpp

void nForest(int n) {
	// Write your code here.
	int i,j;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << "* ";
          }
		cout<<"\n" ;
        }
}
